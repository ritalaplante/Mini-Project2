        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p> We chose to analyze the dataset "College Majors" from Five Thirty Eight. The dataset contains information on outcomes for
            various college majors. Select variables include median earnings by major, enrollment by major, employment rate by major, 
            the share of women enrolled in each major, and the major category. We created a series of dashboards to analyze how outcomes
            differ by college major.
